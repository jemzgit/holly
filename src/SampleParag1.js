        Donald Franciszek Tusk ([ˈdɔnalt franˈt͡ɕiʂɛk ˈtusk] ( listen); born 22 April 1957) is a Polish politician and historian. He has been President of the European Council since 1 December 2014. Previously he was Prime Minister of Poland (2007–2014) and a co-founder and chairman of the Civic Platform (Platforma Obywatelska) party.[1]

Tusk has been involved in Polish politics since the early 1990s, having founded several political parties and held elected office almost continuously since 1991. He was elected Prime Minister in 2007 and with his Civic Union party's victory in the 2011 Polish parliamentary election, he became the first Prime Minister to be re-elected since the fall of Communism in Poland.[2]

In 2014, he became President of the European Council, and was re-elected to this position in 2017. He resigned as Polish Prime Minister to take the role, having been the longest-serving Prime Minister of the Third Polish Republic.
Tusk was born in Gdańsk in northern Poland.[3] His father, also named Donald Tusk (1930–1972), was a carpenter, and his mother, Ewa (née Dawidowska) Tusk (1934–2009),[4][5] was a nurse.[3] His grandfather Józef Tusk (1907–1987) was a railway official who was imprisoned at the Neuengamme concentration camp; later, as a former citizen of the Free City of Danzig, he was apparently conscripted by German authorities into the Wehrmacht.[6]

Tusk got his Scottish first name because his paternal grandmother Juliana travelled abroad in her youth and became enamoured of a lord called Donald. She gave this name to her son, who passed it on to her grandson.[7]

Tusk credits his interest in politics to watching a clash between workers on strike and riot police when he was a teenager.[3] He enrolled at the University of Gdańsk to study history, and graduated in 1980.[8] While studying, he was active in the Students' Solidarity Committee, a group that opposed Poland's communist rule at the time.[8]
Tusk was one of the founders of the Liberal Democratic Congress (Kongres Liberalno-Demokratyczny KLD), which in the 1991 elections won 37 seats in the lower house of parliament.[8] The KLD later merged with the Democratic Union (UD) to become the Freedom Union (UW).[8] Tusk became deputy chairman of the new party, and was elected to the Senate in the next election in 1997.[8] In 2001, he co-founded the Civic Platform, and became deputy speaker in parliament after the party won seats in the year's election.[3] in 2005, Tusk was defeated in the presidential election by Lech Kaczynski, and the Civic Platform lost Parliament to the Law and Justice party.[3]
